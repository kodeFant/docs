# Settings

The `{{ settings }}` variable is a simple array. It contains all settings throughout the TYPEMILL system, such as: 

* The user settings for the system.
* The user settings for the themes.
* The user settings for the plugins.

All of these settings are merged and managed by TYPEMILL in the background. This is pretty handy, because you can use all settings within one variable. 

## Useful Settings

The following settings might be useful for your theme:

### {{ settings.title }}

The title of the website. The default value is `TYPEMILL`.

### {{ settings.author }}

Thee author of the website. The default value is `unknown`.

### {{ settings.copyright }}

The Copyright information of the website. The default value is `copyright`.

### {{ settings.startpage }}

Defines whether there is a separate start or "Home" page, or not. Default value is `true`.

### {{ settings.theme }}

The name of the theme that is in use. Default value is `typemill`.

### {{ settings.version }}

The version of TYPEMILL that is in use. A value of the format `0.0.1`.

## Additional Settings

There a some more settings that are probably not very useful for your theme:

### {{ settings.themeFolder }}

The folder of the theme. The default value is `theme`.

### {{ settings.contentFolder }}

The folder of the content. The default value is `content`. 

### {{ settings.rootPath }}

The full path to the root of the website. 

### {{ settings.themePath }}

The full path to the theme of the website.

### {{ settings.authorPath }}

The full path to the author theme. This theme is actually only in use for the setup path, but might hold an admin dashboard in future.

### {{ settings.displayErrorDetails }}

Defines whether the error display is off or on. Default value is `false`.

Some more information is provided by the Slim framework, that runs under the hood of TYPEMILL. You will probably never use that information.

## Settings for Themes and Plugins

You have also access to all plugin and theme settings. Simply use them like this: 

````
{{ settings.themes.mytheme.mythemesetting }}
{{ settings.plugins.myplugin.mypluginsetting}}
````

You have to replace `mytheme` and `myplugin` with the name of the theme or plugin, and the `mythemesettings` and `mypluginsettings` with the name of the settings you use. You can find the name of the settings in the YAML-file of the plugin or theme. 

For example: The standard theme of TYPEMILL is called `typemill`. And there you can edit the label of the start button displayed on the startpage. The name of the variable is `start`. So you can simply print it out like this: 

````
<button>{{ settings.themes.typemill.start }}</button>
````
