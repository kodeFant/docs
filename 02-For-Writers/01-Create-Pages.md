# Create And Reorder Pages

To create and reorder new pages, you can simply use the navigation on the right side of the author panel. You can choose to create a new folder or a file. You can also move and re-order items with drag & drop.

## Limitations for Ordering

There are some limitations that you should know:

* The number of characters in a page name is limited to 60 right now.
* You can move a folder within the same level, but you cannot move a folder inside another folder.

The reasons for these limitations are obvious: If you move a folder to another folder, then all urls of the folder and its files will change. This is a nightmare for your readers and for search-engines, so we decided to restrict it a bit.

## Posts for Blog- or News-Sections

As of version 1.3.3 you can change the content-type of a folder from pages to posts in the meta-tab of the folder-page. Posts are sorted by date in descending order and they cannot be reordered with drag & drop. This is why they do not appear in the navigation. Instead you will find a list of posts below the content-area of the folder. You can also create new posts there.

Good news: You can change the type of a folder whenever you want. Typemill is smart enough and rewrites all existing content of a folder and sort them by date. You can change the date manually in the meta-tab of each page. If no manual date is set, then typemill uses the create-date.
