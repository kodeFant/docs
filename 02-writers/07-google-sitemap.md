# Google Sitemap

A Google sitemap is very useful for SEO, and often required. Typemill creates a Google sitemap out of the box and stores it in the cache folder. You can find the url for the sitemap in the system settings (basically it is something like `https://yourwebsite.net/cache/sitemap.xml`). Simply add the url to the Google search console and you are done. The sitemap will update once a day. You can also trigger a manual update with the F5 key (Windows).
