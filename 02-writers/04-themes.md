# Themes

Typemill ships with a standard theme called "Cyanine". Cyanine is an univeral theme that you can use for documentation, as well as for any other kind of text-work. You can configure the theme in the author panel under `settings` and `themes`.

For more themes, head over to the [Typemill Theme Directory](https://themes.typemill.net).

If there is a new version of the theme available, then you will see an update banner in the theme area of the author panel. To update a theme, open your FTP-software, go to the theme folder of your typemill installation, delete the old folder of your theme (e.g. `/themes/typemill`), and upload the new folder.

If you are a developer or web designer, you can easily create your own theme with the Twig templating language. Please read the [theme documentation](/theme-developers) for more details.
