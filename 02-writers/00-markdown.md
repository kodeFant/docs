# Markdown

Typemill uses Markdown for writing. Never heard of Markdown? Markdown is a simple syntax for text formatting, and it is very similar to the markup used by Wikipedia. Markdown uses a handful of special characters like `#` and `*` to format the text. 

The big advantage for writers: They don't have to click a button to format a headline or to create a list. Instead they can format the text during the writing process without any interruptions. This speeds up your writing process tremendously. This is a short example of some markdown text: 

````
# My first level headline
 
This is a paragraph, and now we create an unordered list:
 
- Item
- Another item
- A last item
````

Markdown is used by a lot of technology platforms like GitHub and StackOverflow. With popular tools like Trello and Slack, it is also entering the non technical mainstream.
