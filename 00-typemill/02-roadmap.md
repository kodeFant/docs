# Roadmap

There are a lot of plans for future releases of TYPEMILL, but it's meant to embrace simplicity. To prevent TYPEMILL from becomming a feature soup, it will strictly focus on the needs of writers.

Here are some **milestones** from the past:

* Introduction of TYPEMILL (v. 1.0.0)
* Added a google sitemap (v. 1.0.1)
* Added a table of contents tag (TOC) (v. 1.0.5)
* Introduced plugins (v. 1.1.0)
* Added an author panel for configurations (v. 1.1.3)
* Added math support (mathjax/katex) (v. 1.1.5) 
* Added a basic content editor to edit and delete existing pages (v. 1.2.0)
* Added a draft management for pages (v. 1.2.2)
* Re-order content pages with drag&drop (v. 1.2.3)
* Create new pages (v. 1.2.5)
* Use a visual markdown editor with content blocks (v. 1.2.6)
* Reorder content blocks (v. 1.2.7)
* Upload and handle images (v. 1.2.8)
* Introduced frontend forms and added videos (youtube) (v. 1.2.9)
* Editor: Edit other block formats visually (v. 1.2.10)
* Editor: Edit tables visually (v. 1.2.11)
* Editor: Add content blocks above existing blocks (v. 1.2.12)
* Editor: Create definition-lists visually (v. 1.2.13)

* Editor & Plugin: Search plugin and footnotes in visual mode (v. 1.2.16)
* Editor: Edit inline formats like links, bold and italic (v. 1.2.17 - 1.2.18)
* Editor: Discard changes (1.2.18)
* Editor: Modularize the visual editor (1.2.19)
* Meta-tabs for pages (1.3.0)

And here is the **roadmap** for the future:

* Roles and rights (v. 1.4.X)
* Content distribution (v. 1.5.X)

In the long run, TYPEMILL should become a lightweight (but fully featured) publishing system with many more features: 

* Additional output formats like mobi, epub and pdf.
* Member area with pro-content.
* Microservices for pro-features like job-adds, service providers, or text-adds. 
* Many more themes.
* Plugins for comments, RSS, E-Mails, newsletters, and much more.
