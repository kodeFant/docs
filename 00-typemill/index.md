# Typemill

TYPEMILL is a simple and lightweight flat-file CMS. It has a clear focus on the author experience, and provides a dashboard for distraction-free editing and web publishing. It was created especially for a non-technical audience,  and tries to keep web publishing as simple as possible.

The **author dashboard** provides easy configuration for themes and plugins, and an editor for content pages. Authors can choose between a raw markdown editor, and a new visual markdown editor with an user-friendly WYSIWYG-mode. With the interactive navigation, authors can create and organize their content-pages with a drag & drop file system.

**Developers** who want to extend Typemill have access to a flexible and easy system for themes and plugins.
